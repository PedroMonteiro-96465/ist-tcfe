\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The main goal of this laboratory was achieved once that we were able to architecture an AC/DC circuit.    This circuit was successfully analyzed using both Ngspice and Octave and we concluded that the differences between the theoretical and simulation results were very small with an error of. This error is due to the presence of non-linear components in the circuit. The circuit had a total cost of 42.3 MU and a final merit of 0.1327215.
