% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is create an AC/DC converter circuit using an envelope detector and a voltage regulator with an architecture decided by the students. To do so we created the circuit presented below. In the circuit it can be identified a full wave rectifier that is used in order to achieve DC voltage. Then we use a capacitor to estabilize the voltage value. Finally the use of a voltage regulator that allow us to obtain a constant output voltage value of 12 Volts. The theoretical analysis was made using the Octave toll and for the simulation analysis we used the Ngspice Software.
