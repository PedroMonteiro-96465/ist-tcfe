\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To sum up, in this assignment, the main goal was successfully achieved. This objective was to analyze circuits with linear components such as resistors and controlled sources using two different methods. 

The proximity verified between the theoretical and simulated values in this laboratory project can be explained by the simplicity and linearity of the system, which rendered the theoretical calculation a linear set of equations that were quickly solved by the Octave software.

Nevertheless, the small discrepancies between both sets of values are due to approximations of the given data (resistance, voltage values) by the Octave and the Ngspice, as these software have a different level of digit precision.
